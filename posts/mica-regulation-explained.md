# MiCA Regulation Explained: What It Means for Stablecoin Holders

The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation — better known as MiCA — is the European Union's comprehensive framework for regulating cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. It is the most significant piece of crypto legislation in the world, and it directly affects anyone holding or using EUR stablecoins.

This guide explains MiCA in plain language: what it requires, which stablecoins are compliant, and what it means for you as a user.

## What Is MiCA?

MiCA is an EU-wide regulation that creates a single legal framework for crypto assets across all 27 EU member states. Before MiCA, each country had its own rules (or no rules at all), creating a fragmented and confusing landscape for users and companies.

MiCA covers three main areas:

- **Crypto-asset issuers** — Companies that create and issue tokens must follow specific rules around transparency, reserves, and governance
- **Crypto-asset service providers (CASPs)** — Exchanges, custodians, and other crypto businesses must be licensed and supervised
- **Stablecoins** — MiCA creates specific rules for tokens pegged to currencies or assets, requiring full reserve backing and regular audits

MiCA was signed into law in 2023, with stablecoin rules taking effect in June 2024 and the full framework applying to all crypto businesses by **July 1, 2026**.

## How MiCA Classifies Stablecoins

MiCA doesn't actually use the word "stablecoin." Instead, it defines two categories:

**E-Money Tokens (EMTs)** are tokens pegged to a single currency — like EURC being pegged to the euro. EMTs must be issued by a licensed Electronic Money Institution (EMI) or credit institution. The issuer must hold 100% reserves in secure, liquid assets.

**Asset-Referenced Tokens (ARTs)** are tokens pegged to multiple currencies, commodities, or a basket of assets. ARTs face stricter requirements because they're seen as potentially systemic to financial stability.

Most EUR stablecoins, including EURC, EURS, and EURI, fall under the EMT category.

## What MiCA Requires from Stablecoin Issuers

MiCA sets strict rules that every stablecoin issuer must follow:

**Full reserve backing** — Every stablecoin must be backed 1:1 by liquid reserve assets. Issuers cannot invest reserves in risky or illiquid assets. Reserves must be held with regulated custodians, separate from the issuer's own funds.

**Right of redemption** — Holders must be able to redeem their stablecoins for euros at face value at any time. Issuers cannot charge excessive fees for redemption.

**Regular audits and transparency** — Issuers must publish regular reports on their reserves and undergo independent audits. Users should be able to verify that the stablecoin is fully backed.

**Whitepaper requirements** — Every stablecoin must have a published crypto-asset whitepaper that clearly explains how it works, the risks involved, and the rights of holders.

**Governance and risk management** — Issuers must have proper governance structures, business continuity plans, and risk management procedures.

## Which EUR Stablecoins Are MiCA-Compliant?

As of February 2026, the following major EUR stablecoins have achieved MiCA compliance:

**EURC (Circle)** — Fully MiCA-compliant. Circle obtained an EMI license in France through its entity Circle France SAS. EURC is the largest MiCA-compliant EUR stablecoin with over €413 million in circulation.

**EURCV (Societe Generale / SG Forge)** — Issued by SG Forge, a subsidiary of Societe Generale, one of Europe's largest banks. EURCV benefits from the bank's existing regulatory framework.

**EURI (Eurite / Membrane Finance)** — MiCA-compliant, issued under an EMI license.

**EURE (Monerium)** — Issued under an e-money license, making it compliant with MiCA's EMT requirements.

Some older stablecoins, such as EURT (Tether's Euro token), have seen their supply shrink significantly as issuers that cannot meet MiCA requirements exit the European market.

## The July 2026 Deadline

The most important date in MiCA's timeline is **July 1, 2026**. This is the deadline for all crypto-asset service providers (exchanges, custodians, wallet providers) to be fully licensed under MiCA. After this date:

- Unlicensed exchanges cannot operate in the EU
- Only MiCA-compliant stablecoins can be listed on EU-regulated exchanges
- Crypto service providers must report transactions to tax authorities under the new DAC8 directive

For stablecoin holders, this means that **non-compliant stablecoins may be delisted from European exchanges**. If you hold a stablecoin that isn't MiCA-compliant, you may need to swap it for one that is.

## What MiCA Means for You as a User

**Better protection.** MiCA gives stablecoin holders legal rights — including the right to redeem your tokens for euros at any time. If an issuer fails, your reserves are segregated and protected.

**More transparency.** Issuers must publish reserve reports and whitepapers. You can verify that your stablecoin is actually backed.

**Fewer choices (but safer ones).** Some stablecoins will exit the EU market because they can't meet MiCA requirements. The ones that remain will be more regulated and trustworthy.

**Tax reporting.** Under DAC8 (which works alongside MiCA), crypto service providers must report your transactions to EU tax authorities starting in 2026. This doesn't change your tax obligations, but it means enforcement will increase.

**DeFi is mostly unaffected.** MiCA primarily targets centralized service providers. Decentralized protocols like Aave and Uniswap are not directly regulated by MiCA, though the stablecoins they support must be compliant to remain accessible.

## MiCA vs Other Regulations Around the World

MiCA is the most comprehensive crypto regulation in the world. Here's how it compares:

**United States** — The US has no equivalent comprehensive framework. Stablecoins are regulated through a patchwork of state and federal rules. USDC is regulated but under US law, not EU law.

**United Kingdom** — The UK is developing its own crypto framework outside MiCA (post-Brexit). UK rules may differ from EU requirements.

**Singapore and Hong Kong** — Both have their own crypto licensing regimes, but neither is as broad as MiCA.

MiCA's advantage is that it creates one set of rules for all 27 EU countries, making it easier for companies to operate across Europe and for users to know what protections they have.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is MiCA?**
MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) is the EU's comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. It creates uniform rules across all 27 EU member states for how crypto assets are issued, traded, and managed.

**When does MiCA take full effect?**
MiCA's stablecoin rules have been in effect since June 2024. The full regulation, including licensing requirements for all crypto service providers, takes effect on July 1, 2026.

**Is EURC MiCA-compliant?**
Yes. EURC is fully MiCA-compliant. Circle obtained an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license in France. EURC is the largest MiCA-compliant EUR stablecoin.

**What happens to non-compliant stablecoins after MiCA?**
Non-compliant stablecoins may be delisted from EU-regulated exchanges after July 2026. Users holding non-compliant tokens should consider swapping to MiCA-compliant alternatives like EURC.

**Does MiCA regulate DeFi?**
MiCA primarily targets centralized crypto service providers, not decentralized protocols. However, stablecoins used in DeFi must still comply with MiCA's issuance requirements.

**Does MiCA affect taxes?**
MiCA itself is not a tax regulation, but it works alongside DAC8, which requires crypto service providers to report user transactions to EU tax authorities starting in 2026.
