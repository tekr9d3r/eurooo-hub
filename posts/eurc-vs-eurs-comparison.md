# EURC vs EURS: Which EUR Stablecoin Should You Choose?

When it comes to Euro stablecoins, two names dominate: **EURC** by Circle and **EURS** by Stasis. Both maintain a 1:1 peg with the Euro, but they differ significantly in DeFi integration, regulatory status, and chain availability.

This guide compares both to help you pick the right one.

## EURC: The Circle Standard

**EURC** is issued by Circle — the same company behind USDC, one of the world's largest stablecoins. That pedigree matters. Circle's infrastructure, regulatory expertise, and institutional relationships give EURC advantages that are hard to match.

**What makes EURC stand out:**

- **MiCA-compliant** — Circle was among the first to receive full authorization under the EU's new crypto regulation
- **Monthly audits** — Grant Thornton attests to EURC reserves every month, not quarterly
- **Multi-chain** — native on Ethereum, Base, Avalanche, and Solana
- **Deep DeFi integration** — available on Aave, Morpho, Curve, Uniswap, Summer.fi, and more
- **Strong liquidity** — benefits from Circle's global USDC infrastructure

**Things to consider:** Circle is US-headquartered (though EU-licensed), and EURC launched in 2022 — a shorter track record than EURS.

## EURS: The European Pioneer

**EURS** by Stasis launched in 2018, making it the longest-running EUR stablecoin. Based in Malta with an EU e-money license, Stasis offers a European-first approach that appeals to users who prefer local issuers.

**What makes EURS stand out:**

- **8-year track record** — survived the 2022 crypto winter and multiple market crises without losing its peg
- **European issuer** — Malta-based with EU e-money license
- **Direct bank redemption** — withdraw to your European bank account directly through Stasis
- **Transparent reserves** — quarterly attestations from top accounting firms

**Things to consider:** EURS has fewer DeFi options (primarily Curve and select lending protocols), supports fewer chains (Ethereum and Polygon), and publishes audits quarterly rather than monthly.

## Where You Can Earn Yield

This is where the difference becomes most noticeable.

**With EURC,** you have extensive options. On Ethereum, Morpho's Gauntlet vault offers around 5.33% APY, while Aave V3 provides a more conservative 2%. On Base, you can access Aave V3 at roughly 1.4%, Summer.fi around 2.9%, and YO Finance near 3.7%. Each protocol offers a different risk-reward profile.

**With EURS,** your options are more limited. You can provide liquidity in Curve pools on Ethereum and access select lending markets, but there are no major vault strategies or multi-chain opportunities comparable to what EURC offers.

## How They Compare on Regulation

Both EURC and EURS are regulated, but the frameworks differ.

EURC is **fully MiCA-compliant**. Circle received its EU authorization in July 2024, which means EURC reserves must be held 1:1 in segregated EU bank accounts, users have legal redemption rights, and reserve attestations are published monthly. This is currently the gold standard for EUR stablecoin regulation.

EURS operates under **Malta's e-money framework** and is transitioning to full MiCA compliance under transitional provisions. Stasis maintains audited fiat reserves and publishes quarterly attestations. The regulatory protection is real but not yet at the MiCA-specific level.

## Which Should You Choose?

**Choose EURC if you want:**

- The widest range of DeFi yield opportunities
- Multi-chain flexibility (Ethereum, Base, Avalanche, Solana)
- The strongest regulatory framework under MiCA
- Monthly reserve audits for maximum transparency

**Choose EURS if you want:**

- A European-based, Malta-regulated issuer
- An 8-year proven track record of peg stability
- Simple, direct EUR bank withdrawals
- To support the original EUR stablecoin pioneer

## Can You Hold Both?

Absolutely — and many users do. Holding both EURC and EURS spreads your risk across two different issuers, two different regulatory frameworks, and two different infrastructure setups. If one issuer ever faced problems, you'd still have exposure through the other.

A common split is 60-70% EURC (for DeFi access) and 30-40% EURS (for diversification and off-ramping).

## Market Share Perspective

EURC has grown to represent over 60% of EUR stablecoin TVL in DeFi as of 2026, driven largely by its integration with major lending protocols like Aave and Morpho. EURS maintains a steady but smaller presence, with its user base more focused on holding and off-ramping than active DeFi participation.
