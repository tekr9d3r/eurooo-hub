# How to Buy EURC: A Step-by-Step Guide for Europeans

EURC is the largest Euro stablecoin by market cap, issued by Circle and backed 1:1 by euro reserves. Whether you want to use EURC for DeFi yields, payments, or simply holding euros on-chain, this guide walks you through every way to buy it.

## What Is EURC?

EURC is a Euro-pegged stablecoin issued by Circle, the same company behind USDC. Each EURC token is backed by one euro held in reserve, audited monthly, and fully compliant with the EU's MiCA regulation. EURC is available on multiple blockchains including Ethereum, Base, Solana, Avalanche, and more.

As of February 2026, EURC has a market cap of over **€413 million** and holds **64.9% of the entire EUR stablecoin market**. It is the most widely supported Euro stablecoin in DeFi.

## Option 1: Buy EURC on a Centralized Exchange

The simplest way to get EURC is through a centralized exchange (CEX). These platforms let you buy EURC directly with euros from your bank account.

### Coinbase

Coinbase is Circle's closest partner and offers the most seamless EURC experience. You can buy EURC directly with EUR via bank transfer (SEPA) with no conversion fees. Coinbase supports EURC withdrawals to Ethereum, Base, and Solana.

**Steps:**
1. Create a Coinbase account and complete identity verification (KYC)
2. Deposit EUR via SEPA bank transfer (free, takes 1–2 business days) or instant deposit via card
3. Search for "EURC" and buy the amount you want
4. Withdraw to your self-custody wallet if you plan to use DeFi

### Bitstamp

Bitstamp is a Luxembourg-based exchange with strong European roots. It supports EURC/EUR trading pairs and SEPA deposits. Fees are competitive, typically 0.1–0.5% depending on volume.

### Kraken

Kraken supports EURC trading and offers SEPA deposits. It's a well-regulated exchange with a strong track record in Europe.

### Other Exchanges

EURC is also available on OKX, Bitpanda, and several other exchanges. Check that the exchange supports withdrawals on your preferred blockchain before buying.

## Option 2: Swap on a Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

If you already hold crypto in a self-custody wallet, you can swap other tokens for EURC directly on a DEX — no account or KYC required.

### On Ethereum or Base

Use **Uniswap** to swap ETH, USDC, or other tokens for EURC. Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, Coinbase Wallet), select EURC as the output token, and confirm the swap.

On **Base**, gas fees are typically under €0.01, making small swaps very cost-effective. On Ethereum mainnet, gas fees can range from €1–10 depending on network congestion.

### On Solana

Use **Jupiter** (jup.ag) to swap SOL, USDC, or other Solana tokens for EURC. Solana transactions are near-instant and cost fractions of a cent.

## Option 3: Mint EURC Directly from Circle

If you're an institutional user or need large amounts, you can mint EURC directly through Circle's platform. This requires a Circle Account with full business verification. You send euros to Circle and receive EURC 1:1. There are no minting fees, but Circle requires a business account for direct minting.

## Which Blockchain Should You Choose?

EURC is available on multiple chains. Your choice depends on what you plan to do with it:

**Base** is the best option for most users. Gas fees are extremely low (under €0.01), EURC liquidity is strong, and major DeFi protocols like Aave and Morpho are available. Base is built on Ethereum's technology, so it inherits its security model.

**Ethereum** is the original and most liquid chain for EURC. It has the deepest DeFi ecosystem, but gas fees are higher (€1–10 per transaction). Best for larger transactions where gas fees are proportionally small.

**Solana** offers near-instant transactions and very low fees. EURC liquidity on Solana is growing, though it's still smaller than Ethereum and Base. Good for payments and trading.

**Avalanche** has lower fees than Ethereum and supports EURC with growing DeFi integrations.

## Setting Up a Wallet

To use EURC in DeFi, you need a self-custody wallet. Here are the most popular options:

**MetaMask** — The most widely used wallet for Ethereum, Base, and other EVM chains. Available as a browser extension and mobile app.

**Rabby** — A newer wallet focused on DeFi users. Offers better transaction previews and multi-chain support. Browser extension only.

**Coinbase Wallet** — Not the same as the Coinbase exchange. This is a self-custody wallet with built-in support for Base and easy EURC management.

**Phantom** — The leading wallet for Solana. If you plan to use EURC on Solana, Phantom is the best choice.

## Fees to Expect

**SEPA bank transfer to exchange:** Free or €0–1 on most exchanges.

**Buying EURC on an exchange:** 0–0.5% trading fee depending on the exchange. Coinbase offers zero-fee EURC purchases.

**Withdrawing EURC to your wallet:** Varies by exchange and chain. Base and Solana withdrawals are typically free or very cheap. Ethereum withdrawals may cost €1–5.

**Swapping on a DEX:** 0.05–0.3% swap fee plus gas. On Base and Solana, total cost is typically under €0.10.
