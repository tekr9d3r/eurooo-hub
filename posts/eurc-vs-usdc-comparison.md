# EURC vs USDC: Should Europeans Hold Euro or Dollar Stablecoins?

If you're a European DeFi user, you've probably held USDC at some point. It's the most liquid stablecoin in DeFi, and most protocols are built around it. But EURC — Circle's Euro stablecoin — has grown rapidly, and the question is becoming unavoidable: should Europeans hold their stablecoins in euros or dollars?

The answer depends on your goals, risk tolerance, and how you plan to use your stablecoins. This guide compares EURC and USDC across everything that matters.

## The Basics

**USDC** is a US dollar stablecoin issued by Circle. It's the second-largest stablecoin globally with a market cap exceeding $30 billion. USDC is available on virtually every blockchain and supported by almost every DeFi protocol.

**EURC** is a Euro stablecoin, also issued by Circle. It has a market cap of over €413 million (as of February 2026) and is the largest EUR stablecoin by market share (64.9%). EURC is available on Ethereum, Base, Solana, Avalanche, and other chains.

Both are issued by the same company (Circle), backed 1:1 by fiat reserves, and audited monthly. The key difference is the currency they're pegged to.

## Currency Risk: The Hidden Cost of Holding Dollars

This is the most important factor for Europeans, and it's often overlooked.

When you hold USDC as a European, you're effectively taking a position in the US dollar. If the EUR/USD exchange rate moves, your holdings gain or lose value in euro terms — even though your USDC balance stays the same.

**Example:** If you convert €10,000 to USDC when EUR/USD is 1.10, you get $11,000 in USDC. If the euro strengthens to 1.15 while you hold USDC, your $11,000 is now worth only €9,565 — a €435 loss, even though you were in a "stable" coin.

The EUR/USD rate has fluctuated between 1.03 and 1.12 over the past year. That's a potential swing of up to 9% — far larger than most DeFi yields.

**EURC eliminates this risk entirely.** Your euros stay as euros. No forex exposure, no currency conversion, no hidden losses.

## DeFi Yields: EURC vs USDC

USDC has deeper DeFi liquidity, which means more yield opportunities — but the gap is closing.

**USDC yield opportunities** are available on virtually every DeFi protocol. Aave, Morpho, Compound, Spark, and dozens of others support USDC. Lending yields for USDC typically range from 3–8% APY depending on the protocol and chain.

**EURC yield opportunities** are growing rapidly. Aave and Morpho both support EURC lending on Ethereum and Base. Yields for EURC are often comparable to USDC — typically 3–7% APY — and sometimes higher because the EURC lending market is smaller, meaning borrowing demand can push rates up.

The important comparison is **yield after currency risk**. If USDC offers 5% APY but the dollar drops 4% against the euro, your real return is just 1% in euro terms. EURC offering 4% APY with zero currency risk gives you a true 4% return.

## Liquidity and DeFi Support

This is where USDC still has a clear advantage.

**USDC** is supported by virtually every DEX, lending protocol, bridge, and DeFi application. Liquidity pools are deep, slippage is minimal, and you can use USDC almost anywhere in DeFi.

**EURC** has strong support on major protocols (Aave, Morpho, Uniswap, Curve) but isn't as widely available as USDC. Some newer or niche protocols may only support USDC. However, EURC liquidity has grown significantly — particularly on Base and Ethereum — and continues to expand.

For everyday DeFi activities (lending, borrowing, swapping), EURC has sufficient liquidity on the major chains. For exotic DeFi strategies or smaller protocols, USDC may still be necessary.

## Regulation and Compliance

Both EURC and USDC are issued by Circle, but they operate under different regulatory frameworks.

**EURC** is regulated under the EU's MiCA framework. Circle holds an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license in France for EURC issuance. MiCA gives European holders specific legal rights, including the right to redeem EURC for euros at face value at any time.

**USDC** is regulated under US state money transmission laws. While it's widely accepted in Europe, USDC doesn't carry the same MiCA-specific protections. After the July 2026 MiCA deadline, the regulatory treatment of non-EU stablecoins on European exchanges may evolve.

For European users, EURC offers stronger regulatory protections under EU law.

## On-Ramp and Off-Ramp Costs

**With EURC**, you deposit euros and get EURC. When you want to cash out, you redeem EURC for euros. No currency conversion at any step. Total cost: effectively zero on platforms like Coinbase.

**With USDC**, you deposit euros, convert to dollars, buy USDC, and eventually reverse the process. Each conversion incurs a forex spread — typically 0.5–1.5%. Over a year of moving money in and out, these costs add up.

This is money you lose regardless of what yields you earn. EURC eliminates conversion costs entirely.

## When to Hold EURC

Hold EURC if you:

- Are based in Europe and earn or spend in euros
- Want to avoid currency risk between the euro and dollar
- Plan to use established DeFi protocols (Aave, Morpho) for yield
- Value MiCA regulatory protections
- Want to minimize on-ramp/off-ramp conversion costs
- Plan to eventually convert back to euros

## When to Hold USDC

Hold USDC if you:

- Need access to niche DeFi protocols that don't yet support EURC
- Are actively trading and need maximum liquidity
- Have a view that the US dollar will strengthen against the euro
- Need to interact with USD-denominated DeFi strategies

## The Hybrid Approach

Many European DeFi users hold both. A practical approach:

- Keep your **core savings** in EURC to avoid currency risk
- Use USDC for **specific DeFi strategies** that require dollar-denominated assets
- **Earn yield** on EURC through Aave or Morpho for risk-adjusted returns
- Periodically rebalance based on your needs

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Should Europeans hold EURC or USDC?**
For most European users, EURC is the better choice for holding value and earning yield because it eliminates currency risk and conversion fees. USDC is better for accessing the widest range of DeFi protocols.

**Is EURC yield higher than USDC yield?**
EURC and USDC yields are often comparable (3–7% APY on lending protocols). However, EURC yields are effectively higher for Europeans because there's no currency risk eating into returns.

**Can I swap between EURC and USDC?**
Yes. You can swap EURC for USDC (and vice versa) on any major DEX like Uniswap. Liquidity is good on Ethereum and Base.

**Are both EURC and USDC issued by Circle?**
Yes. Both are issued by Circle, backed 1:1 by fiat reserves, and audited monthly. EURC is regulated under EU MiCA, while USDC is regulated under US law.

**Will USDC still be available in Europe after MiCA?**
USDC is expected to remain available, as Circle has taken steps to comply with MiCA requirements for its operations in Europe. However, the regulatory landscape is still evolving.
