# What Are EUR Stablecoins? A Complete Guide

Euro stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the Euro. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, EUR stablecoins aim to hold a stable value — making them ideal for everyday transactions, savings, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

## Why EUR Stablecoins Matter for Europeans

If you're based in Europe and using crypto, you've probably been forced to work with USD-denominated stablecoins like USDC or USDT. That means paying currency conversion fees and dealing with forex risk every time you move money in or out.

EUR stablecoins solve this by keeping everything in your home currency:

- **No conversion fees** — you skip the 1-3% forex spread entirely
- **No exchange rate risk** — your holdings stay pegged to the Euro, not the Dollar
- **Stronger protections** — MiCA-compliant tokens like EURC give you legal recourse under EU law
- **Native DeFi access** — earn yield on your Euros without ever touching USD

## The Major EUR Stablecoins

### EURC by Circle

Circle — the company behind USDC — launched EURC in 2022. It's now the largest EUR stablecoin in DeFi by total value locked. EURC is backed 100% by fiat reserves, audited monthly by Grant Thornton, and fully MiCA-compliant. It's available on Ethereum, Base, Avalanche, and Solana.

### EURS by Stasis

EURS is the longest-running EUR stablecoin, live since 2018. Issued by Malta-based Stasis, it has an e-money license and maintains audited fiat reserves. EURS is primarily available on Ethereum and Polygon.

### EURe by Monerium

Monerium issues EURe under an e-money license, making it directly redeemable for bank euros. It's available on Ethereum, Polygon, and Gnosis Chain, where it benefits from very low transaction costs.

### EURA by Angle (formerly agEUR)

EURA uses a hybrid approach combining algorithmic mechanisms with reserves. It's available across Ethereum and several Layer 2 networks.

## How EUR Stablecoins Maintain Their Peg

Not all EUR stablecoins work the same way. There are three main approaches:

**Fiat-backed** is the most common model. Issuers like Circle hold actual Euros in regulated bank accounts. Every EURC token in circulation has a matching Euro in reserve, and you can redeem it 1:1 at any time. This is the most transparent and safest model.

**Over-collateralized** stablecoins are backed by crypto collateral worth more than the tokens issued. If you deposit €1,500 worth of ETH, you might mint €1,000 in stablecoins. This provides a safety buffer against volatility.

**Algorithmic** stablecoins use smart contracts to automatically adjust supply based on demand. This model is less common for EUR stablecoins and carries more risk.

## Where to Use EUR Stablecoins

### Lending and Borrowing

Deposit EUR stablecoins into protocols like [Aave or Morpho](https://www.eurooo.xyz/app) to earn interest. You can also use them as collateral to borrow other assets without selling your position.

### Trading

Trade EUR pairs directly on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or Curve — no need to convert to USD first. This saves on fees and simplifies your tax reporting.

### Cross-Border Payments

Send Euros to anyone globally with near-instant settlement. A transfer that might take 1-3 business days through traditional banking settles on-chain in minutes.

### Savings

DeFi lending protocols offer yields that often exceed what traditional Euro savings accounts provide. Current rates range from 2-6% APY depending on the protocol.

## Risks to Consider

EUR stablecoins are far more stable than typical crypto, but they're not risk-free:

- **Smart contract risk** — DeFi protocols can have bugs or exploits. Stick to audited protocols with long track records.
- **Depeg risk** — stablecoins can temporarily lose their peg during extreme market stress, though major tokens like EURC have maintained strong peg stability.
- **Regulatory risk** — while MiCA provides clarity today, regulations can evolve. Compliant issuers are better positioned to adapt.
- **Counterparty risk** — fiat-backed stablecoins rely on the issuer's reserves. Monthly audits (like Circle's) reduce but don't eliminate this risk.

## Key Takeaways

1. EUR stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged 1:1 to the Euro, designed for European users
2. They eliminate currency conversion fees and forex risk for EU-based DeFi users
3. EURC (Circle) is the largest by DeFi TVL; EURS (Stasis) has the longest track record
4. You can earn 2-6% APY by depositing into lending protocols
5. MiCA regulation provides legal protections that unregulated tokens don't offer
