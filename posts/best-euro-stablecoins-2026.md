## 1. EURC (Circle) — Best Overall

**Market cap:** €413.5M | **Market share:** 64.9% | **MiCA compliant:** Yes

EURC is the clear market leader and the best EUR stablecoin for most users. Issued by Circle — the same company behind USDC — EURC is backed 1:1 by euro reserves, audited monthly by Grant Thornton, and fully MiCA-compliant through Circle's EMI license in France.

**Why it's #1:** EURC has the deepest DeFi liquidity of any EUR stablecoin. It's supported on Aave, Morpho, Uniswap, Curve, and dozens of other protocols. It's available on Ethereum, Base, Solana, Avalanche, and more. If you're earning yield or using EUR stablecoins in DeFi, EURC is the default choice.

**Best for:** DeFi users, yield earners, anyone who wants the safest and most liquid EUR stablecoin.

## 2. EURCV / EUR CoinVertible (SG Forge) — Best Bank-Issued

**Market cap:** €58.2M | **Market share:** 9.1% | **MiCA compliant:** Yes

EURCV is issued by SG Forge, a digital assets subsidiary of Societe Generale — one of Europe's largest banks. It's the most prominent bank-issued EUR stablecoin and represents the growing trend of traditional financial institutions entering the stablecoin market.

**Why it's #2:** EURCV benefits from the institutional credibility and regulatory framework of a major European bank. It's available on Ethereum and Solana, though its DeFi integration is more limited than EURC.

**Best for:** Users who prioritize institutional backing and traditional finance credibility over DeFi flexibility.

## 3. AEUR / Anchored Coins AEUR — Strong Contender

**Market cap:** €52.4M | **Market share:** 8.2% | **MiCA compliant:** In progress

AEUR is issued by Anchored Coins and has grown significantly, becoming the third-largest EUR stablecoin. Available on Ethereum and BSC, it offers a solid alternative for users operating on Binance Smart Chain.

**Best for:** Users active on BSC who need a Euro stablecoin.

## 4. EURI / Eurite — Regulated Newcomer

**Market cap:** €45.9M | **Market share:** 7.2% | **MiCA compliant:** Yes

EURI (formerly known as Eurite) has grown rapidly since achieving MiCA compliance. Available on Ethereum and BSC, it's positioned as a fully regulated alternative for European users.

**Best for:** Users looking for a MiCA-compliant alternative to EURC.

## 5. EURE / Monerium EUR emoney — Most Chains

**Market cap:** €26.2M | **Market share:** 4.1% | **MiCA compliant:** Yes

Monerium's EURE is issued under an e-money license, making it directly redeemable for bank euros. What makes EURE unique is its availability on eight chains, including Gnosis, Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon — the widest multi-chain support of any EUR stablecoin.

EURE also has a unique feature: it's linked to an IBAN, meaning you can send and receive euros directly as EURE without going through an exchange.

**Best for:** Users who need multi-chain flexibility or direct bank integration.

## 6. EURR / StablR Euro — Solana-Focused

**Market cap:** €12.5M | **Market share:** 2.0% | **MiCA compliant:** Yes

EURR is issued by StablR and available on Ethereum and Solana. It has positioned itself as a MiCA-compliant option for the Solana ecosystem.

**Best for:** Solana-native users who want a regulated EUR stablecoin.

## 7. EUROP / Schuman EUROP — Multi-Chain Regulated

**Market cap:** €8.1M | **Market share:** 1.3% | **MiCA compliant:** Yes

Schuman's EUROP is available on Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and Plasma. It's one of the newer MiCA-compliant EUR stablecoins targeting multi-chain deployment.

**Best for:** Users on Polygon or Avalanche looking for a regulated EUR option.

## 8. EURS / Stasis Euro — The Pioneer

**Market cap:** €7.9M | **Market share:** 1.2% | **MiCA compliant:** Partial

EURS was one of the first EUR stablecoins, launching in 2018. Once the market leader, EURS has seen its share decline as newer, MiCA-compliant competitors emerged. It's still available on Ethereum, Polygon, Stellar, and Algorand.

EURS is issued by Malta-based Stasis and maintains audited fiat reserves, but its MiCA compliance status is less clear than newer competitors.

**Best for:** Users on Stellar or Algorand where other EUR stablecoins aren't available.

## How to Choose the Right EUR Stablecoin

Your choice should be based on three factors:

**1. What chain are you on?** If you're on Ethereum or Base, EURC is the obvious choice. On BSC, consider AEUR or EURI. On Solana, EURC or EURR. On Gnosis, EURE.

**2. Do you need DeFi support?** If you plan to earn yield on Aave, Morpho, or other lending protocols, EURC has the deepest integration by far.

**3. Is MiCA compliance important to you?** If regulatory protection matters (and it should), stick with EURC, EURCV, EURI, EURE, EURR, or EUROP.

## The Market Is Consolidating

The EUR stablecoin market is following a clear pattern: the top five stablecoins hold over **93% of total supply**, and the gap between EURC and everyone else is growing. EURC's 64.9% market share is dominant, and its DeFi integrations continue to expand.

For new users entering the EUR stablecoin market, EURC is the safest and most practical choice. For those with specific chain or use-case requirements, the alternatives listed above each have their strengths.

## What About the Bank Stablecoin Consortium (Qivalis)?

Ten European banks — including BNP Paribas, ING, UniCredit, and Danske Bank — have announced plans to launch a joint EUR stablecoin through a new entity called Qivalis, based in Amsterdam. This initiative could reshape the EUR stablecoin landscape when it launches, bringing institutional-grade credibility and banking network integration.

However, as of February 2026, this project is still in development. We'll cover it in detail when it launches.
