# Crypto Savings in Europe: EUR Stablecoin Yields vs Bank Deposits

European savers have a new option. Instead of earning 0.5–2% in a bank savings account, you can deposit EUR stablecoins like EURC into DeFi lending protocols and earn significantly higher yields. But how do these two approaches actually compare — and what are the trade-offs?

This guide breaks down the real numbers, risks, and protections on both sides to help you decide where your euros work hardest.

## What European Banks Are Paying in 2026

After the ECB's rate adjustments, traditional savings accounts in Europe offer modest returns. Here's what the landscape looks like:

**Standard savings accounts** at major banks (Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, ING) typically offer between **0.5% and 1.5% APY**. These accounts are insured up to €100,000 per depositor under the EU Deposit Guarantee Scheme.

**High-yield savings accounts** from neobanks like N26, Revolut, and bunq offer slightly better rates, typically between **2% and 3.5% APY**. These accounts often require premium subscriptions or minimum balances.

**Fixed-term deposits** (1–2 year lock-ups) can offer **2.5% to 4% APY**, but your money is locked and early withdrawal usually incurs penalties.

The key advantage of bank deposits is safety. Your euros are protected by deposit insurance, and you face zero technical risk. The downside is that after inflation, your real returns are often close to zero.

## What DeFi Yields Look Like for EUR Stablecoins

DeFi lending protocols allow you to supply EUR stablecoins and earn yield from borrowers. The rates are variable and change based on supply and demand, but they have consistently outperformed bank rates.

**Aave (Ethereum, Base)** — Aave is the largest DeFi lending protocol. Supplying EURC on Aave typically earns between **3% and 7% APY**, depending on market conditions and the chain you use. Base tends to offer slightly higher rates than Ethereum mainnet due to lower liquidity.

**Morpho (Ethereum, Base)** — Morpho optimizes lending by matching lenders and borrowers peer-to-peer. EURC yields on Morpho often range from **4% to 8% APY**, sometimes higher during periods of strong borrowing demand.

**Sky (formerly Maker)** — Sky's savings rate for EUR-denominated assets has offered competitive yields, particularly for users willing to interact with their vault system.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

**Yield:** Bank savings offer 0.5–3.5% APY. DeFi lending offers 3–8% APY. DeFi yields are variable but have consistently been 2–4x higher than bank rates.

**Safety:** Bank deposits are protected by EU deposit insurance up to €100,000. DeFi deposits have no deposit insurance, but MiCA-compliant stablecoins like EURC are backed 1:1 by fiat reserves held in regulated institutions.

**Liquidity:** Bank savings are usually instant-access. DeFi deposits are also instant-access — you can withdraw your EURC at any time with no lock-up period.

**Currency risk:** None on either side. Both bank deposits and EUR stablecoins are denominated in euros.

**Technical risk:** Banks have none. DeFi carries smart contract risk — the possibility that a bug in the protocol's code could lead to loss of funds. Major protocols like Aave have been audited extensively and have operated for years without incident, but the risk is not zero.

## Understanding the Risks of DeFi Yields

DeFi yields are higher than bank rates for a reason — you're taking on risks that don't exist in traditional banking.

**Smart contract risk** is the most significant. If a protocol's smart contract has a vulnerability, deposited funds could be at risk. This is why it's important to use established, audited protocols with long track records. Aave, for example, has secured billions of dollars for years without a major exploit.

**Stablecoin depeg risk** means the EUR stablecoin you hold could temporarily lose its 1:1 peg to the euro. MiCA-compliant stablecoins like EURC mitigate this by maintaining full fiat reserves, but the risk exists for less-regulated tokens.

**Variable rates** mean your yield can change daily. A protocol offering 6% today might offer 3% tomorrow if borrowing demand drops. Unlike a fixed-term bank deposit, DeFi yields are never guaranteed.

**Regulatory risk** is decreasing as MiCA takes full effect, but the DeFi regulatory landscape is still evolving. New regulations could change how protocols operate in Europe.

## Who Should Consider DeFi Yields?

DeFi yields on EUR stablecoins make the most sense if you:

- Already hold or use cryptocurrencies and are comfortable with wallets and on-chain transactions
- Want higher returns than bank savings without taking on the volatility of crypto markets
- Understand and accept smart contract risk
- Are using MiCA-compliant stablecoins like EURC for regulatory protection
- Want instant liquidity without lock-up periods

If you're new to crypto, uncomfortable with self-custody, or need deposit insurance on your savings, traditional bank accounts remain the safer choice.

## How to Get Started

If you want to earn DeFi yields on your euros, here's a practical path:

1. **Get a wallet** — Set up a self-custody wallet like MetaMask, Rabby, or Coinbase Wallet
2. **Buy EURC** — Purchase EURC on a centralized exchange (Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp) and withdraw to your wallet
3. **Choose a chain** — Ethereum and Base both have strong EURC lending markets. Base offers lower gas fees
4. **Compare yields** — Use [eurooo.xyz](https://www.eurooo.xyz/app) to compare current rates across Aave, Morpho, and other protocols
5. **Supply your EURC** — Connect your wallet to the protocol and deposit. You'll start earning yield immediately

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Are DeFi yields on EUR stablecoins higher than bank savings rates?**
Yes. DeFi lending protocols like Aave and Morpho typically offer 3–8% APY on EURC, compared to 0.5–3.5% at European banks. However, DeFi yields are variable and carry smart contract risk.

**Is my money insured in DeFi?**
No. DeFi deposits are not covered by the EU Deposit Guarantee Scheme. However, MiCA-compliant stablecoins like EURC are backed 1:1 by fiat reserves, providing a different form of protection.

**Can I lose money in DeFi lending?**
It's possible but unlikely on established protocols. The main risk is a smart contract exploit. Major protocols like Aave have been audited extensively and have operated for years without a significant loss event.

**Do I need to pay tax on DeFi yields in Europe?**
Yes. DeFi yields are generally taxable income in most European countries. Tax treatment varies by country — consult a local tax advisor for specifics.

**What is the minimum amount I need to start?**
There's no minimum for most DeFi protocols, but transaction fees (gas) mean very small amounts may not be cost-effective. On Base, gas fees are typically under €0.01, making it practical for smaller amounts.
